From our [Constitution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lxkUe52r92h4GxQyhrm2xn-0U7jV5pEk/view):

> soup ink. is a co-operative run by like-minded creatives in Belfast and its surrounding areas. The primary aim of soup ink. is to promote and celebrate local talent through mutual-aid and shared resourcing. We want to create a new platform for projects of all creative outlets. As a co-operative, soup ink. is owned and run by its members; each member is fully accountable to the rest of the group and vice versa.

Openness and transparency underpin how we work, our Constitution has been approved by all our members, and it is viewable at the link above.

Our [finances](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/4/folders/1aV0FT00k6qWA3q0v18QqLe-QclF4UQgi) our made publicly available to ensure accountability and scrutiny.

[Minutes](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/4/folders/16XAl8cDlwndFgFw0wWBVeSSzjzmRrzga) are available for all previous meetings.
