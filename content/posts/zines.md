## No Separate Worlds

This is a collaborative zine created over two nights in the Sunflower. 

The first was our annual prisoner solidarity poetry evening for [June11](https://june11.noblogs.org) (a day of solidarity with Marius Mason and all long-term anarchist prisoners).

The theme for June 11 this year was "There Are No Separate Worlds". We heard pieces on or inspired by this theme as well as poems that challenged oppression and domination.

The source material and inspiration for this event are available [here](https://archive.org/details/prisoner-updates-soupink)

The second was an event centred around 'practical animism'.

These have been combined to create this zine and all proceeds will be split between [Addameer](https://www.addameer.org/) and local court support nad prisoner efforts on the island of Ireland.
